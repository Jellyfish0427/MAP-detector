Implement the MAP probability of the classifier for 60 instances of 3 types of wines and 13 different features.

## Information of each feature
1. Alcohol 
2. Malic acid 
3. Ash 
4. Alcalinity of ash 
5. Magnesium 
6. Total phenols 
7. Flavanoids 
8. Non Flavonoid phenols 
9. Proanthocyanins 
10. Color intensity 
11. Hue
12. OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 
13. Proline 
All the features are independent and the distribution of them is Gaussian distribution.
